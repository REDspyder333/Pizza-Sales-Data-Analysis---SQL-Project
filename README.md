# üçï Pizza Sales Data Analysis Using SQL  

##  Project Overview  
This project demonstrates how **SQL** can be used to analyze business data and extract meaningful insights. Using a pizza sales dataset, I wrote and executed **10 SQL queries** ranging from easy to advanced, leveraging key SQL concepts such as **joins, subqueries, aggregations, and filtering**.  

The goal of this project is to showcase practical data analysis skills that help in answering important business questions like:  
- What are the peak sales hours?  
- Which pizzas generate the highest revenue?  
- What are the most popular pizza sizes and categories?
